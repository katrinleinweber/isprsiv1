title: "ISPRS Working Group IV/1: Multi-dimensional Modelling"
---

<h1>Our mission</h1>

<p>The constant development of communication and information technologies have led to the multiplication of data sources and the dissemination of mobile technologies. On one side, geospatial data are now massively generated from sensors and from crowdsourcing applications. On the other side, technologies allow for the analysis and visualisation of more complex data. For that purpose, data need to be easily accessible online for any kind of operations. All of these require the development of specific models that allow for efficient processing on large sets of data and for interoperability between applications and users. Temporal and 3D representations of the urban environment start to be available for everyday use. Further from that, other dimensions can be integrated to provide a more meaningful representation, bringing broader perspectives in geospatial applications.</p>

<p>ISPRS Working Group IV/1â€™s mission is to encourage the development of new theoretical models that go beyond the temporal and spatial dimensions and to promote their application in the geospatial domain. This includes all dimensions along which data can be described such as the scale dimension, both spatial and temporal, for example for mobile display or time series analysis. Integration of other dimensions such as semantic granularity and versioning are also considered as providing further representations adapted to different user purposes.</p>
